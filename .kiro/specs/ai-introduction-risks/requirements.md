# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature adds a comprehensive introduction section to the AI Learning Portal that educates users about both the advantages and risks of AI technology. The section will provide balanced, thoughtful content about AI's cognitive risks, the "too much too soon" problem, and principles for healthy AI interaction. This introduction will serve as essential context before users engage with the glossary and quiz content, helping them develop a more nuanced understanding of AI's impact on human cognition and decision-making.
