# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Interactive AI 101 Module is a self-contained educational feature that provides users with a comprehensive glossary of 16 core AI terms and an interactive quiz system. The feature is designed to validate the interactive AI learning experience by delivering role-specific context for different business personas (Business & Ops, PM/Designers, Engineers, Data Scientists) while maintaining full compatibility with GitHub Pages static hosting.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a business professional, I want to access a comprehensive AI glossary with role-specific context, so that I can understand AI concepts relevant to my work responsibilities.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user visits the glossary page THEN the system SHALL display all 16 AI terms with their definitions
2. WHEN a user views a term definition THEN the system SHALL show role-specific context for Business & Ops, PM/Designers, Engineers, and Data Scientists
3. WHEN a user clicks on a term's external link THEN the system SHALL navigate to the authoritative source in a new tab
4. WHEN a user accesses the glossary THEN the system SHALL display terms in a readable, accessible format that meets WCAG AAA compliance

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a learner, I want to take interactive quizzes on AI terms, so that I can reinforce my understanding and track my progress.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user starts a quiz THEN the system SHALL randomly select 3 questions from the available question pool
2. WHEN a user completes a question THEN the system SHALL mark that term as used to avoid immediate repeats
3. WHEN a user answers all questions in a quiz THEN the system SHALL display their score and provide feedback
4. WHEN a user has answered questions for all 16 terms THEN the system SHALL reset the used questions flag to allow a new cycle
5. WHEN a user selects an answer THEN the system SHALL provide immediate feedback on correctness
6. WHEN a quiz is completed THEN the system SHALL store the results in localStorage for progress tracking

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a returning user, I want to see my learning progress and quiz history, so that I can track my improvement over time.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user visits the page THEN the system SHALL increment and display their visit count from localStorage
2. WHEN a user completes a quiz THEN the system SHALL record their score and attempt count in localStorage
3. WHEN a user views their progress THEN the system SHALL display their best quiz score and total attempts
4. WHEN a user views their progress THEN the system SHALL show which terms they have been quizzed on
5. IF a user clears their browser data THEN the system SHALL reset all progress tracking to initial state

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the application to work entirely on GitHub Pages, so that we can deploy and maintain it without backend infrastructure.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application is built THEN the system SHALL generate only static files compatible with GitHub Pages
2. WHEN quiz data is needed THEN the system SHALL load questions from a static JSON file
3. WHEN user data needs to be stored THEN the system SHALL use only localStorage (no external databases)
4. WHEN the application is deployed THEN the system SHALL work without any server-side processing
5. WHEN GitHub Actions runs THEN the system SHALL automatically build and deploy to the gh-pages branch

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user with accessibility needs, I want the application to be fully accessible, so that I can use all features regardless of my abilities.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user navigates with keyboard only THEN the system SHALL provide full functionality access
2. WHEN a user uses screen readers THEN the system SHALL provide appropriate ARIA labels and semantic markup
3. WHEN a user has visual impairments THEN the system SHALL meet WCAG AAA color contrast requirements
4. WHEN a user resizes text to 200% THEN the system SHALL remain fully functional and readable
5. WHEN a user accesses interactive elements THEN the system SHALL provide clear focus indicators

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a content maintainer, I want quiz questions to be easily manageable, so that I can update or add questions without code changes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN quiz questions need to be updated THEN the system SHALL load questions from a JSON file in the repository
2. WHEN a new question is added to the JSON file THEN the system SHALL automatically include it in the question pool
3. WHEN question data is structured THEN the system SHALL include term, question text, multiple choice options, correct answer, and glossary link
4. WHEN the JSON file is malformed THEN the system SHALL handle errors gracefully and display appropriate messages
